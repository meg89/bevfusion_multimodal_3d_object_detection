# bevfusion_multimodal_3d_object_detection
This project explores the possibility of combining a camera, Lidar, and Radar sensor modalities to improve the 3d object detection accuracy in autonomous driving. This project will not meet very high detection accuracy but will be suitable enough to explore the results for 2 vs 3 modalility fusion.
